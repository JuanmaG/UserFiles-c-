# UserFiles-c-
Basic c++ console program,controlling dynamic memory through pointers and arrays,where you can create "users" (struct Usuarios) 
add "files" (struct Fichero) to them, administrate both of them and edit them on the user list (struct TablaUsuarios).

Most of the code is in Spanish due to this being coded while I was learning(sorry for the inconvenience) I´ll leave a brief list of the functionalities for a better understanding.

Functionalities:
1-"Create file"
2-"Create User"
3-"Print available files"
4-"Check user list"
5-"Insert file in User"
6-"Print user´s files"
7-"Delete file from User"
8-"Delete user from the list"
9-"Delete the full list"
10-"Search user using exact login attribute"
11-"Clear memory and end program execution"
