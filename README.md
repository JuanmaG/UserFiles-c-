# UserFiles-c-
Basic c++ console program,where you can create "users" (struct Usuarios) 
add "files" (struct Fichero) to them, administrate both of them and edit them on the user list (struct TablaUsuarios).

Most of the code is in Spanish due to this being coded while I was learning(sorry for the inconvenience)
